The project, as suggestive as its name may propose, is an .scad file that tests how a cylindrical object with a specific diameter may fit in some cylindrical holes, each with a diameter designed a little bit bigger/smaller than the other. The source code is provided in this repository to be compiled in OpenSCAD 2021.01. This project was made in scope of 3D Printing, so the results can change depending on the plastic material you are using to print, or the permitted printing area of your 3D printer. Fell free to change the source code as you desire.

Here is an image of the compiled results.
